# Computer Vision-Based Tracking and Tactical Analysis of Badminton Players
- Developed a real-time sports analysis system for badminton using a hybrid approach combining YOLOv8 for player detection and DeepSORT for multi-frame tracking.

- Built and annotated a custom dataset consisting of 200 clips from various real match footage to train the detection model, ensuring accurate performance across varied scenarios.

- Extracted key player movement metrics such as speed, acceleration, distance, and zone coverage for performance evaluation.

- Used LSTM for tactical zone prediction, achieving over 90% accuracy in anticipating player movement across court zones.
